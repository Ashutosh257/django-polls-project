When somebody requests a page from your website – say, “/polls/34/”, Django will load the mysite.urls Python module because it’s pointed to by the ROOT_URLCONF setting. It finds the variable named urlpatterns and traverses the patterns in order. After finding the match at 'polls/', it strips off the matching text ("polls/") and sends the remaining text – "34/" – to the ‘polls.urls’ URLconf for further processing. There it matches '<int:question_id>/', resulting in a call to the detail() view like so:

> detail(request=<HttpRequest object>, question_id=34)

The question_id=34 part comes from <int:question_id>. Using angle brackets “captures” part of the URL and sends it as a keyword argument to the view function. The question_id part of the string defines the name that will be used to identify the matched pattern, and the int part is a converter that determines what patterns should match this part of the URL path. The colon ( : ) separates the converter and pattern name.


Your project’s TEMPLATES setting describes how Django will load and render templates. The default settings file configures a DjangoTemplates backend whose APP_DIRS option is set to True. By convention DjangoTemplates looks for a “templates” subdirectory in each of the INSTALLED_APPS.


### Very Important 
```
Now we might be able to get away with putting our templates directly in polls/templates (rather than creating another polls subdirectory), but it would actually be a bad idea. Django will choose the first template it finds whose name matches, and if you had a template with the same name in a different application, Django would be unable to distinguish between them. We need to be able to point Django at the right one, and the best way to ensure this is by namespacing them. That is, by putting those templates inside another directory named for the application itself.
```

1 way to render the template is 
```
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.template import loader

from .models import Question


def index(request):
    latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]
    template = loader.get_template("polls/index.html")
    context = {
        "latest_question_list": latest_question_list,
    }
    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))

```

### A shortcut: render()
```
from django.shortcuts import render

from .models import Question


def index(request):
    latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]
    context = {"latest_question_list": latest_question_list}
    return render(request, "polls/index.html", context)
```


### Namespacing URL names


> The tutorial project has just one app, polls. In real Django projects, there might be five, ten, twenty apps or more. How does Django differentiate the URL names between them? For example, the polls app has a detail view, and so might an app on the same project that is for a blog. How does one make it so that Django knows which app view to create for a url when using the {% url %} template tag?


```
from django.urls import path

from . import views

app_name = "polls"
urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="index"),
    path("<int:question_id>/", views.detail, name="detail"),
    path("<int:question_id>/results/", views.results, name="results"),
    path("<int:question_id>/vote/", views.vote, name="vote"),
]
```

change **polls/index.html** template from:

```
<li><a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
```

to 

```
<li><a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
```
